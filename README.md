In this example, you will see how to use SQLite database with Recyclerview.

SQLite is the most popular database engine. This is due to it’s serverless, zero-configuration nature yet still reasonably performant. SQLite simply exists a single file and runs in a single process. This makes it efficient hence can easily be used in resource-constrained devices.

RecyclerView on the other hand is an adapterview that allows us render large datasets. Especially data coming from databases like sqlite and webservices qualify as good for being rendered in recyclerview. RecyclerViews are popular because of their flexibility and ease of use. Once we’ve retrieved our data from sqlite we will show this data in recyclerview.
